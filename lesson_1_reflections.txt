How did viewing a diff between
two versions of a file help you see
the bug that
was introduced?
Viewing a difference between 2 versions
helped me to spot the bug
because of the spelling error
in the 2 versions.
One was written as "spacr" and the other one was "space".

How could having easy access
to the entire history of a file 
make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
This is because if we update our file and a
bug occurs so we can easily compare it to 
the previous version to find the bug.

What do you think are the pros and cons 
of manually choosing when to create a commit, 
like you do in Git, vs having versions 
automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pros: It's according to our own convinience.
Cons: It's tiresome.

Why do you think some version control systems, 
like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, 
while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because Git is designed for projects.

How can you use the commands git log 
and git diff to view the history of files?
git log shows all commits
git diff changes in any 2 commits

How might using version control make you 
more confident to make changes that 
could break something?
I can easily use git checkout 
and restore the previous versions.

Now that you have your workspace set up, 
what do you want to try using Git for?
For working on a project.
