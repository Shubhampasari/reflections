What happens when you initialize a repository? 
Why do you need to do it?
It creates a file named .git
Now we can track all changes to our directory.

How is the staging area different 
from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
It gives us more control and lets us decide
which files do we want to include in the first commit.
